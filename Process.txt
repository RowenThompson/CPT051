1) Analyze the problem
	Queue, while loops, list.append()
	what are my varialbes? Price of items, taxes, shopping, 

	I reviewed while loop video
	I reviewed lists and qeueues  12/11
	i researched list.apppend()
	i researched data types 
2.)Planning a solution
	Data Dictionary price int, shopping_cart queue/list
	Flowchart (handdrawn or draw.io)

	I drew a flowchart (flowchart_12_11.jpg)
	I wrote a data_dictionarty 

3.) Coding a solution
	Writing code statments

	added while loop line_65

4.)Testing and Troubleshooting
	Test DATA(S): Use a calculator, do it on paper, use EXCEL, Google Sheets, 
	If your data does not match your test data, check your code and check your test data
	
	If you have a problem: 1, 2, or 3.

	Total was a negative number line_56. Returned to step 1 analyze the solution.
